## Growth Mindset
Growth mindset is a persons ability to persevere. A person with a growth mindset believes that they can grow and change with experience. A person with a growth mindset uses failure as an opportunity for improvement. A growth mindset is the opposite of a fixed mindset, which suggests that success in inherent and doesn't require effort and development. 
### How to Keep a Growth Mindset
1. Use affirmations, which can be words and phrases. Examples of affirmations can be "*I can do this*" or "*this is hard, but it is a learning opportunity*"
2. Take time to assess what I am doing. This supports keeping focus, and improves long and short term frustration levels.
3. Set **SMART** goals. Smart goals are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and timely.
